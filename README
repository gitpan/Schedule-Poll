NAME
    Schedule::Poll - Evenly schedule recurring events with various intervals

SYNOPSIS
        use Schedule::Poll;

        # Let's run a few things every 3 seconds,
        # and some things every 6 seconds

        my $config = {
            foo => 3,
            bar => 3,
            baz => 3,
            zip => 6,
            zoo => 6,
            zat => 6
        };

        my $poll = Schedule::Poll->new( $config );

        while(1) {

            if (my $aref =  $poll->which  ) {

                for my $each (@$aref) {

                    print "$each fired!\n";
                }
            }
            sleep 1;
        }

METHODS
  new
    Constructor. Accepts a hashref with the values being an interval in
    seconds. Each interval used should be a divisor of 86400.

        my $poll = Schedule::Poll->new({
    
            foo => 300 # 5 minutes
            bar => 600 # 10 minutes
            baz => 5   # 5 seconds
    
        });

  which
    Returns an arrary reference containing the items for that current tick
    interval.

        $poll->which;

  Examples
        $href = {
            a => 3,
            b => 3,
            c => 3
        };

        Timeline:
            interval | 1  2  3  4  5  6  
            ---------+------------------
            key      | a  b  c  a  b  c

        $href = {
            a => 3,
            b => 3,
            c => 3,
            d => 6,
            e => 6,
            f => 6
        };

            interval | 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12 
            ---------+--------------------------------------
            key      | b  a  c  b  a  c  b  a  c  b   a   c
